A Github action based upon the [Go parser and validator](https://github.com/italia/publiccode-parser-go)
for [publiccode.yml](https://github.com/italia/publiccode.yml) files.

`publiccode.yml` is an international standard for describing public software, which
should be placed at the root of Free/Libre and Open Source software repositories.

This parser performs syntactic and semantic validation according to the
[official spec](https://docs.italia.it/italia/developers-italia/publiccodeyml-en/en/master/index.html).

## Examples

Include this action in your repo by creating `.github/workflows/publiccode-validation.yml`
and edit where needed:

```yml
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  publiccode_validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: publiccode validation
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - uses: italia/publiccode-parser-action@v0.0.2-alpha
      with:
        publiccode: 'publiccode.yml' # relative path to your publiccode.yml
```
